# ðŸ“„â†”ðŸ“„ WPGraphQL for Posts 2 Posts

WordPress plugin that creates GraphQL connections for all registered Posts 2 Posts connections.

## Overview

- All registered Posts 2 Posts connections will be automatically added as connections in the GraphQL schema.
- The field for each in the GraphQL schema will be the name of the Posts 2 Post connection, converted to camelCase and with the word "Connection" appended to it. So if the Posts 2 Posts connection was registered as "projects_to_managers", the field in the GraphQL schema will be named "projectsToManagersConnection" (see the example below).
- Supports posts <-> posts, posts <-> users, and users <-> users connections.

### Example

Let's say you have registered a Posts 2 Posts connection between the `project` custom post type on your site and the `user` object, like this:

```php
function register_p2p_connection() {
  p2p_register_connection_type( [
    'name' => 'projects_to_managers',
    'from' => 'project',
    'to'   => 'user'
  ] );
}
add_action( 'p2p_init', 'register_p2p_connection' );
```

With this plugin activated, you can query for the users connected to projects, like this:

```graphql
query getProjects {
  projects(first: 10) {
    nodes {
      databaseId
      title
      projectsToManagersConnection {
        nodes {
          databaseId
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also query from the other direction, and get the projects connected to users, like this:

```graphql
query getUsers {
  users(first: 10) {
    nodes {
      databaseId
      name
      projectsToManagersConnection {
        nodes {
          databaseId
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Minimum Software Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) 0.12.1+
- [Posts 2 Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/) - 1.6.6+

## Future Enhancements

- Expose [connection metadata](https://github.com/scribu/wp-posts-to-posts/wiki/Connection-metadata) as edge fields in the GraphQL schema.
